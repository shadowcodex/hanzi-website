  Today is Friday, the weather is nice, it's not raining, and it's not too hot.
  Wang Fang and Xie Peng are university classmates. They are studying Chinese in Beijing. This year they are twenty years old.
  In the morning, they went to school to read books and study Chinese characters. The teacher asked, 'Can you write these Chinese characters?' Wang Fang said, 'Yes!' Xie Peng said, 'Not very well.' The teacher smiled and said, 'It's okay.'
  At noon, they went to a restaurant to eat. Wang Fang wanted to eat rice and vegetables, and Xie Peng wanted to drink tea. They asked, 'Excuse me, how much are these dishes?' The waiter said, 'Not much, one dish is eight yuan, and one cup is three yuan.' They said, 'Okay, we'll buy these.'
  In the afternoon, they went to the store to buy things. Wang Fang bought some fruit and a beautiful piece of clothing. Xie Peng bought an apple.
  In the evening, they went home and watched a movie. Wang Fang asked, 'Do you like this movie?' Xie Peng said, 'I do!' They were very happy.
