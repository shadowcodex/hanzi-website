# HANZI Website

This repo is a collection of my personal learning material around Mandarin. See `Study material`. I have my own methods for studying and working that worked for me. I also wanted to play around with AI assisted coding. So 98% of all code you see in this repo was generated by Chat GPT. 100% of all dialogs, grammar rules, and short stories were generated by Chat GPT as well.


See Study Material for general Chat GPT Prompts I use.

Also if you'd like I have a Mandarin focused ChatGPT bot that helps you learn. Just give it a phrase in english or mandarin surrounded by quotes. It's here: [https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67a2f171c0dc8191a6ba6d87bbc9ee91-mandarin-pronunciation-guide](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67a2f171c0dc8191a6ba6d87bbc9ee91-mandarin-pronunciation-guide)


## Generate Stories

1. Make sure you have your gem dependencies installed (See scripts).
2. Run `ruby ai_story_generator <x> <f>` where `<x>` is the number of stories you want to generate and `<f>` is your input character set file.
3. Run `ruby ai_translate_hanzi.rb <f>` where `<f>` is the file of story blocks you want to translate.
4. Rename the output json `/_data/hanzi_translations.json` to `/_data/readings.json` or add the json entries to your list.
5. Run `ruby generate_lessons_and_stories.rb` to create all story pages.
6. Rerun serve to see them

## Generate Lessons

TODO: Create this script that:

1. Takes in list of chapter character sets.
2. For each chapter generates 3-4 dialogs that MUST use that latest chapters hanzi, and only include the previous hanzi to make stories. (Old prompt is in fluff/Lessons).
3. Generate Grammar rules for that chapter.
4. Optionally pass in a integer representing the chapter you want to generate, or `<int>+` for that chapter onward.
5. Runs the same translation system that stories use (Move into common framework).
6. Create json docs for each lesson.
7. Generate dictionaries for Lesson New Words, and each Dialog.
8. write them out to lesson output file.
