This repo is a collection of my personal learning material around Mandarin. See `Study material`. I have my own methods for studying and working that worked for me. I also wanted to play around with AI assisted coding. So 98% of all code you see in this repo was generated by Chat GPT. 100% of all dialogs, grammar rules, and short stories were generated by Chat GPT as well.


See Study Material for general Chat GPT Prompts I use.

Also if you'd like I have a Mandarin focused ChatGPT bot that helps you learn. Just give it a phrase in english or mandarin surrounded by quotes. It's here: [https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67a2f171c0dc8191a6ba6d87bbc9ee91-mandarin-pronunciation-guide](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67a2f171c0dc8191a6ba6d87bbc9ee91-mandarin-pronunciation-guide)
